## 2. Current State Assessment

### 2.1 Scaffold Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `frontend/` | ✅ | Next.js 14+ app |
| `backend/` | ✅ | FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 |
| `docs/` | ✅ | getting-started, guides, reference, releases |
| `helm/` | ✅ | K8s deployment manifests |
| `.github/workflows/` | ✅ | CI/CD + Claude integration |
| `AGENTS.md` | ✅ | Per-repo agent instructions |
| `PLAN-v1.2.md` | ✅ | Feature roadmap |
| `docker-compose.yml` | ✅ | Local dev stack |
| `tests/` | ✅ | pytest + pytest-asyncio |
| `alembic/` | ✅ | Database migrations |
| `dclaw-manifest.json` | ❌ | DPanel registration |

### 2.2 Code Maturity
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Python source files (backend) | ~27 |
| TypeScript/TSX files (frontend) | ~16 |
| Total source files | ~43 |
| Tests | ✅ Present |
| Alembic migrations | ✅ Present |
| DPanel manifest | ❌ Missing |

### 2.3 Feature Maturity
- **P0 Foundation:** Partially implemented

---

## 3. Gap Analysis

| # | Gap | Severity | Fix |
|---|-----|----------|-----|
| 1 | Missing `dclaw-manifest.json` | 🔴 | Create frontend/public/dclaw-manifest.json for DPanel |
| 2 | Partial implementation — needs more domain features | 🟡 | Expand backend services and frontend pages per P0 roadmap |

---

## 4. Sacred Architecture & Tech Stack

> **NON-NEGOTIABLE. Every DClaw product MUST use this exact stack.**

| Layer | Technology | Version |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Frontend** | Next.js 14+ | App Router, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| **Backend** | FastAPI | Pydantic v2, SQLAlchemy 2.0, asyncpg |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL 16 | CloudNativePG operator in K8s |
| **Vector DB** | Qdrant / pgvector | Only if RAG / semantic search |
| **Cache / Bus** | Redis | 7.x |
| **Object Storage** | MinIO | Latest |
| **Workflow** | Temporal.io | Only if automation/orchestration |
| **Auth** | Logto | JWT validation on all protected routes |
| **Billing** | Stripe | Metered or per-seat |
| **K8s Operator** | Go + controller-runtime | 0.18 |
| **LLM Local** | Ollama | Apple Silicon |
| **LLM Cloud** | OpenRouter + Kimi K2.5 | Fallback |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana | Latest |

### 4.1 Python Rules
- `ruff` formatting enforced
- Type hints on ALL public APIs
- `pydantic` v2 for schemas
- `sqlalchemy` 2.0 style (`Mapped`, `mapped_column`)
- `pytest` + `pytest-asyncio` for tests
- Functions < 50 lines
- No `print()` — use `structlog`

### 4.2 TypeScript / Next.js Rules
- Strict TypeScript (`strict: true`)
- Tailwind for ALL styling
- `cn()` utility for conditional classes
- No `any` without `// @ts-ignore`

### 4.3 Docker Standards
- Port mappings MUST match container listen port
- Healthchecks MUST use binaries present in base image
- `docker compose config` must pass before shipping
- Service type MUST be `ClusterIP`
- TLS required on all ingress

## 9. AI Copilot Mandate (YC S25/W26 Requirement)

Every DClaw app MUST have an AI Copilot as its first P0 feature. The copilot must:
1. Be contextually aware of the app's domain data
2. Use RAG over the app's knowledge base where applicable
3. Suggest next actions, not just answer questions
4. Be accessible from every page via floating chat or sidebar
5. Fall back to local Ollama when cloud is unavailable

---

## 10. Next Tasks for Vibe Coders

1. **Complete P0 features**: Finish any incomplete P0 backend services and frontend pages.
2. **Add missing scaffold**: Fill gaps identified above (docs, helm, tests, manifest, etc.).
3. **Start P1 features**: Implement the first 2 P1 features to deepen domain capability.
4. **Polish and integrate**: Ensure health endpoints, Docker builds, and DPanel manifest are production-ready.

---

## 11. Domain Research Notes

Inspired by Offboarding software, Rippling, Workday. Secure offboarding protects IP and culture.
